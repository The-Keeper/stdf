## Background

STDF uses SVG Sprites technology for icons, which helps reduce HTTP requests and improve page performance.

STDF's SVG Sprites use [SVG symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/symbol), which is similar to CSS Sprite technique. It combines SVG files in the project into a single file and uses the `<use>` element in SVG to display the corresponding icons.

You can think of it as a type of font, except that it is composed of SVG and can be styled using CSS properties such as color and size. Therefore, for larger or more complex icons with multiple colors, it is recommended to use individual SVG files instead of placing them in the symbol.

Compatibility is not an issue. Refer to [MDN symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/symbol#browser_compatibility) for more information.

## rollup-plugin-stdf-icon

STDF has developed a Rollup/Vite plugin called rollup-plugin-stdf-icon, which combines SVG files in the project into SVG Sprites. Please refer to [rollup-plugin-stdf-icon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-stdf-icon) for specific usage. Due to the diversity of SVG formats, there may be cases where rollup-plugin-stdf-icon does not handle them accurately. In such cases, please raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/dufu1991/stdf/issues) and provide details about the SVG file.

Alternatively, you can use other SVG Sprites synthesis tools or manually combine them. You can also ask the designer to provide the corresponding SVG Sprites along with the design materials.Or, for icon libraries like Remix Icon, you can directly download a selection of multiple icons as SVG Sprites.

## Built-in Icons

Some of the icons used in STDF components are sourced from [Remix Icon Library](https://remixicon.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Remix-Design/remixicon)). Many thanks to them! 🙏🏻🙏🏻

**If you are using these components, please make sure that the `symbol.svg` file in your project includes the corresponding icons.**

Here are the icons and their corresponding components:

| ri-error-warning-line         | Toast            |
| ri-information-line           | Toast            |

You can find the SVG source files for these icons in `node_modules/stdf/assets/svg_base/`.

## Icon Name

If the `name` is `'slot'`, use a slot to render, otherwise use the corresponding SVG icon in `symbol.svg` to render.

## Icon Color

If `theme` is not passed or passed in as `false`, the icon color will inherit the parent's text color. If `true` is passed, the icon color will change according to the theme (including light and dark modes). If you want to achieve a custom color and the color includes both light and dark modes, it is recommended to use CSS injection or slot rendering, and configure the light and dark colors in `injClass` or slots separately. Please refer to the example.

## Color Priority

Color priority: slot > injClass > theme > default.

## Offset

In European and West Asian typesetting, there is a baseline, but there is no baseline in East Asian typesetting, refer to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/baseline). However, due to differences in fonts in different systems, it may cause misalignment when icons are arranged together with text. Adjust the offset to fine-tune these alignments. Or, for some icons, due to differences in visual gravity, an offset is required when laying out to maintain visual balance.

## CSS Injection

The `injClass` parameter can be used to inject a CSS class name (not limited to Tailwind CSS) into the outermost element of the component, which will give the component more customizability in terms of style. Because CSS injection comes last, if there are existing CSS properties on the outermost element, `injClass` will override them. This is also the reason for using `injClass` to customize the icon color.

## Slot

Any element can be inserted (even the Icon component itself), but mainly used for customizing icons or icon colors, such as inserting custom SVGs into the Icon component. Please note the relationship between the viewBox, height, and width of the SVG and the display property. The icon content depends on the element passed in. The parameters such as name, size, and theme in Props will be invalid. The slot will give the component more customizability in terms of content.
